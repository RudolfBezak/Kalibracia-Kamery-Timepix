Andreo,

today i re-check and clarified all. it was quite complicated. the conclusion and status - for this detector, for the existing configuration (let's call it 1st old config - Stepan) it turned out it has problems to be properly well calibrated. thus a second config has been done (IK=5, THL=7+465) including full and good per-px E calibration - done on 23 Dec. i send it here to you - enclosed files. we should use on this detector (SiC L06) from now on this configuration (called 2nd config - Michal). i will use it next week in the VdG n measurements. if you agre I am also giving it and the detector to Cristina who will this week measure protons (in Dresden). we will have thus data with two different configs - important to know and be sure which to use when processing the data. for the old 1st config (IK=5, THL=7+439) my colleagues (Michal + Stepan) will try to produce a working calibration (in few weeks) if successful we will send it / will let you know.
